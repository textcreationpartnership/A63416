            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis morning, about half an hour after One of the clock, broke out a moſt dreadful Fire in the Caſtle, which is thought to have begun in the Lord Deputies Dreſſing-room, by the Beam of the Room go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Room; which taking fire, became immediately ſo outragious, that my Lord himſelf was in great danger of being deſtroyed: In fine, (though, God be thanked, not one perſon is hurt, yet) it has conſum'd all the new Brick-buildings, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Queens Drawing-Room, my Lord's own Appartment, and the Ladies Appartments; wherein my Lady Dutcheſs has received very conſiderable loſs, to the value of ſeveral thouſand pounds, in rich Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It has likewiſe deſtroy'd the Chappel, the King's Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, the Preſence, and the great Dining-room; ſo that that Row is quite burnt, from the great Door and Stairs of the Caſtle Eaſtward, to the very corner of the Wall. As for the other Row, the long Gallery, my Lords Cloſet, the Secretaries Office, and all the other Offices below, with the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings over them, (<hi>viz.</hi> where the young Lady lay) are all blown up. The Conflagration was ſo fierce and devouring, that there is nothing of the Caſtle left (within its walls) but the Hall, Kitchen and Cellar; that is as to the Palace: the out-Lodgings (ſuch as they are) are ſtill ſtanding, tho'd defaced.</p>
            <p>You may, by this ſad Relation, eaſily imagine the ſplender of our Court; but the conſternation of the people cannot well be thought; for the Tower of the Magazine, (which has in it at leaſt 2000 Barrels of Powder) was greatly endanger'd, the Fire coming within 20 yards of it; which, as it would have deſtroy'd half the Town, ſo queſtionleſs many thouſands of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants muſt inevitably have periſhed.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the horrour and alarm of Drums beating, Trumpet ſounding, and People running about diſtracted they knew not whither, in the dead of the night, I (your Friend and Servant) knowing my Service could be but ſmall, and that I ſhould but add one to the Crowd, with what expedition I could, got me ready, and away with my Coach to the <hi>Strand;</hi> where, from half an hour after Two, till the Fire was quite out, (which was full three hours after) did I tow'r it all alone, out of the reach or danger of the Fire.</p>
            <p>My Lord Deputy is remov'd to <hi>White-Fryars,</hi> where he remains till <hi>Chappel-Iſard</hi> be in order, where he will then reſide, he having ſuſtained no ſmall ſhare in this loſs. All the Papers both of his Cloſet, and the Secretaries Office under him, were ſaved before that Appartment was blown up. I am, SIR,</p>

            <p>A Sad Accident happened here about Two of the clock this morning, by Fire that took in the Caſtle, next Chamber to my Lord Deputies. It was firſt perceived blazing through the windows by a Souldier, which ran and beat up his Excellency, who had only time to get out of the Room in his ſhirt. This happened in the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Buildings, which conſumed all to the great Dining-room; the great Magazine of Powder (containing two or three thouſand Barrels) lying in the Tower next the back-gate, to which the Fire was making; but the diligence of his Excellency gave order to blow up the long Gallery, and the Buildings belonging to it; for had the Fire got thither, it would unavoidably have burned the Tower of the Magazine, which ('tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) would have deſtroyed moſt of the City, and could not kill leſs than thouſands of people: but the blowing up of thoſe Buildings put a ſtop to all the Fire, tho' that Palace now lies in Rubbiſh and Aſhes.</p>
            <p>The particular loſſes cannot yet be known, tho' (praiſed be God) we do not yet hear any one Soul hath periſhed in this diſmal Accident. I have ſeen ſeveral Gentlemen of my acquantance, who (having Lodgings in the Caſtle,) have loſt all but their Lives. I do aſſure you this is a true account, and as particular as I could then attain to: In the <hi>interim,</hi> I pray take it not amiſs from him who his</p>
